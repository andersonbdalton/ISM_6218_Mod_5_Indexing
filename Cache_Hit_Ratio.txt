-- This script file has some more detailed queries

-- Though focusing too much on cache hit ratios is
-- probably a mistake, the fundamental concept of

-- First, take a look at some of the statistics
-- avalable from the V$SYSSTAT view.
-- Some of these same statistics are shown
-- in SQL Developer (and Autotrace).
-- The "consistent gets" are fetches of
-- consistent or unmodified blocks
-- (typically the bulk of the IO).
-- The "db block gets" reflect a point-in-time
-- retrieval of a

  name like 'consistent gets%' OR
  name like 'db block gets%' OR
  name like 'physical reads%';


-- This query retrieves the relevant statistics
-- for computing a cache hit ratio.
-- The fetches "from cache" are reads from
-- the database buffer cache (core shared memory).
-- This is probably the best way to look at
-- a cache hit ratio, though you could also
-- retrieve the overall totals (as in next query).
